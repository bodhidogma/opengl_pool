Scott's Notes:
 Hey, Paul helped get my modem configured!

Paul's Notes:
 found out that much of what I was playing with was not working due to
 'cull_face' option
 Got multiple viewports working.. do it while performing draw.
 Blend / stipple seems to be the best way to shade the background.
 2d texmaps working okay!

Soudi's Notes:
 * copy the temp/soudi.* files into the glpool dir and then run 'make soudi'
